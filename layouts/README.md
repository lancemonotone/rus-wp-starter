## Layouts Directory

The layouts in this directory replace the files in the `parts` directory in a future release. Please develop your custom layouts in this directory.

Assets for each module are in the `assets` directory and use the Vite build system. To build the assets, run `npm install` and `npm run build` in the `assets` directory.

## Layouts
Each layout is a single file that contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the layout. The layout file is named the same as the ACF flexible content field group ID. E.G.`{my-flexible-field}.php` and is located in the `layouts` directory.
